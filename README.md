As a fan of Eurovision, I was saddened about it being cancelled this year due to Corona, and since March I've been trying
to fill this void on my soul and my music folder by listening to songs from old editions, and something that always has
been interesting to me is the notable amount of songs in english. While I do understand why this is done (is easier
to make people like your song if more people can understand your song), I was really curious about when this trend
started and what effect does it have on the festival as a while, so there it is!

There are some points here that are very interesting to me. I was expecting Waterloo to have had a bigger influence than 
it really had, the decline between '76 and '78 is curious, and what the actual heck happened on '99?
Also it's interesting to see how once english songs started to dominate in '99, nearly every single year the number one
song is an english song.

Yay, science!
